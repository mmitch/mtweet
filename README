mtweet - Mitch's commandline tweeter with OAuth support

Twitter switched off the old direct API and OAuth is needed now.  I have not
yet found a simple client with OAuth support, so I'm rolling my own...

Requirements:
  Crypt::SSLeay
  HTTP::Request::Common
  LWP::UserAgent
  Net::OAuth (at least 0.16)
(and Data::Dumper for debugging purposes, feel free to comment out)
